    *BIOSECURITY* 

Today on Monday I wish to demystify this topic.

Part of proper flock health management is employment of the best biosecurity practises.

Biosecurity is a general terminology that encompasses all practises aimed at keeping at bay all infectious disease causing agents from the production site.

In our homes for instance,we employment Watchmen,security checks and German shepherds just to see ensure no access to uninvited people .

Poultry diseases are caused by different agents,bacterial,viral , fungal and protozoal.

Some infections for instance viral infections have no cure hence the best control strategy lies in timely vaccination and proper disinfection and biosecurity.

These aforementioned infectious agents are transmitted either directly throughput contact with infected birds,contaminated formites or mechanically through vectors such as rats,stray and wild birds and mosquitoes .

A good biosecurity programme should be holistic,so as to ensure minimum chances of spread of infections into the flock and within the flock.

A proper disinfection regime for the drinkers,feeder and the housing facility is critical.
Foot baths and tyre baths should be provided too.

Egg trays entering the farm should first be disinfected before entry.

Provide gumboots and a unique attire for workers,these should be disinfected regullary,especially when moving from house to house.

The poultry house should be thoroughly disinfected before arrival of a new batch of chicks.

As a rule remember to always isolate sick birds,until veterinary intervention is sought.

Rodent control is another key biosecurity cog .Rodents feed on poultry feed occasioning great feed losses.They also mechanically  transmit a host of diseases to poultry e.g salmonellosis.

As such a good rodent control programme is In-dispensable .

mosquitoes are notorious disease transmitters.Fowl pox virus is harboured and transmitted by mosquitoes.Reason why fowl pox is endemic in mosquito infested areas

Flies on the other hand are the most deadly .The number of infections they mechanically transmit is mindbogglingly,from Newcastle,gumboro,coccidiosis,salmonellosis among others.

This challenge by flies is further complicated by their feeding habits,they first vomit their stomach contents before feeding,their hairy bodies provide attachment to many infectious agents in the flies environment.

TH4  is a very powerful modern disinfectant comprising of 4 quarternary ammonium compounds,glutaraldehyde and terpene oil.The terpene oil further serves as a fly repellant .TH4 is broad spectrum kills all microorganisms

TH4 is used for disinfecting the poultry house,in footbaths and in litter disinfection.This is because it's very strong with a long residual activity.

Ultraxide comprises of one quaternary ammonium compounds and glutaraldehyde.

It's very effective for disinfecting drinkers and feeders.Also very safe and gentle to use for the last fumigation before chicks arrive.Very safe for FOGGING in the presence of chicken Also safe for use through addition in drinking water in case of severe gastro- intestinal infections.

Also helps kill coccidial oocysts in the poultry house 

Lanirat is a safe and effective rodenticide.Its hygienic and cost effective and doesn't encourage bait shyness

Culexon is perfect solution for mosquito control.its highly effective and has a residual protective activity of 3 months.

Agita is a modern housefly bait.Available in two formulations,a wetable powder and ready to use granules .

Agita is highly effective.It contains sugar and tricosene ( sex hormone) that easily attracts flies.Flies are also attracted to the yellow colour.

Upon ingestion of the poison or by simply coming into contact with agita,flies exhibit nervous signs and death is a guarantee.courtesy of ultravetis E.A and Eugene Poultry Farm Ltd stand wakulima soma elewa good morning visit our farms for free training #poultryhousing #eugenepoultryfarmltd </p>
